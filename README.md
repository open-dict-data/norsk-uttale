# norsk-uttale - Audio recordings of Norwegian vocabulary

This repository contains audio from an ongoing project to provide good quality recordings of Norwegian vocabulary being read aloud. The word list is Norwegian (Bokm√•l) and currently available recordings have been made in Standard Eastern Norwegian by [Espen Stranger-Johannessen](https://github.com/espensj).

Unlike other crowd-sourced projects such as [Forvo](http://forvo.com/), this project aims to provide a large amount of audio of consistent quality recorded by a single speaker. If you are able to contribute (open-licensed) audio in other dialects of Norwegian, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Word list

A list of all the words currently recorded can be found [here](ordliste.md). Each of the vocabulary items has been linked to the corresponding audio file.
